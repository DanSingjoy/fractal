# Optimistic Respsect-based DAO
A prototype app for a fractal that uses [Optimistic Respect-based executive contract](../concepts/OREC.md) and non-fungible Respect token ([Respect1155](../respect1155/sc/) to be specific).

Subdirectories:
* [sys](./sys) - configuration and scripts to develop / test / deploy the whole Ordao system.
* [gui](./gui) - frontend for Optimistic Respect-based DAO / Fractal (early work, not much done);

[Instructions for how to use it](./sys/README.md).
